><span class="highlight">Reda</span>, I appreciate how you helped me in my moment of crisis when suffocating from anxiety, not knowing what the hell I was doing with the Terminal. In a crowded class you took the time to make sure I was up to date.  
For this, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. You'll be pleased to know I now use Terminal on a regular basis. I wouldn't say Terminal and I are friends yet but definitely heading in the right direction! Feel safe knowing every time I look at the terminal I think of you hahahah! Thank you for all your support and advice and support!

><span class="highlight">Reda</span>, the coolest guy on the block!   
I don’t think I’ve ever had a lecturer that motivated me so much in learning more and more. You’ve made me more confident in coding and been a great inspiration during these last months.

>Hey <span class="highlight">Reda</span>! ✨   
First of all, I just want to say how amazing was to have you as our first industry leader. Starting to code from scratch with a totally different background was something that made me afraid of doing it. In the back of my mind, my fear was always to not be able to keep up. But with your support, always very attentive to all levels and different contexts that the class has, I was able to unleash the developer inside of me and surprise myself with my potential in the best possible way!   
<br>
And for that, I will always appreciate you. Thanks for all the knowledge and the friendship. You’re the best ✨🌟
