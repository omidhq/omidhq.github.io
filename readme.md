<h3>About this website:</h3>
<p>Even though developed in one dull, dingy autumn week in Stockholm, this website has been made with LOVE and PASSION.</p>
<p>It's a one-page static website built with HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript. There are also some sprinkling of jQuery here and there. Media queries, as well as CSS Grid technic, are behind the responsiveness of the website. And Of-course, this website uses the latest typography, spacing & other modern web design standards.</p>
<p>The 'work sample' section and the blog are generated by <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank">the GatsbyJS framework</a> which is a build tool that uses react on top of JavaScript, before rendering the content into readable HTML documents. Netlify's headless CMS powers the Markdown pages for my blog.</p>
