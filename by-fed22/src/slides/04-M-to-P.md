> I've been enjoying all your lectures since day 1, <span class="highlight">Reda</span> (that's something valuable coming from a real tech dummie as me). I also enjoyed your closeness and friendship attitude. I hope I can catch up on all the terminology to chat about nerd staff with you in the future. Thank you <span class="highlight">Reda</span>!!

Thank you for being a great role model and teacher, and an even better friend. I really appreciate the time you have taken to get to know us and spend the time with us. I feel inspired and motivated by you every time we get to hang out and after every lecture. I hope we can continue to talk after this module and long into the future.
