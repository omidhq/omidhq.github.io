>Thank you <span class="highlight">Reda</span> for making learning code..easier? Yeah, easier to grasp and definitely more structured and focused than I had imagined.

>It’s been challening not so say the least, but i’m thrilled of how much I’ve managed to learn. I’ve enjoyed following along your lectures and never felt them being irrelevant. Rather, shit my head is full, how am I supposed to squeeze another of these concepts in there... But somehow it works and I appreciate to keep being exposed to unfamiliar and complex concepts, just for the sake of hearing it and then later go back to dig deeper. 

    1/2...

> You have a calm and confident vibe that provide a feeling that anything is possible. Just that one need to take it easy and keep working...and working and then we’ll get there 😎   
I can’t come up with anything I wish would had been done differently, can only express my appreciation and the pity we’ll no longer have you leading the way.

THANK YOU 💜<br>
And see you around ✌🏽

    2/2 🤠
